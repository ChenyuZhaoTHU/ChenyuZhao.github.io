This system takes full advantage of advanced MAV to effectively achieve accurate localization of the heterogeneous MAV swarm through collaboration. Subsequently, <i>H-SwarmLoc</i>, a reinforcement learning-based planning method is proposed to plan the advanced MAV with a non-myopic objective in real-time. The experimental results show that the localization performance of our method improves <b>40%</b> on average compared with baselines.",
